Note: Tested on my Nokia 2730c connected via bluetooth and should work on all phones supported by gammu.
For phones which are not S-40 or if you want to connect the phone via USB-cable, the gammurc file needs to be changed accordingly. Refer http://wammu.eu/docs/manual/faq/config.html
If you have an S-40 phone having bluetooth, set it in automatic pairing mode with your PC and go on reading further...
